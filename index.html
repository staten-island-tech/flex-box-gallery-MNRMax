             <p class="object-text">Andromeda bridging is the fastest bridging method in the game, but it has never been succesfully executed for more than 2 blocks. However, it is theoretically possible.</p>

             <p class="object-text">The second fastest bridging method on this list. It is not very common to be good at this bridge and there are probably less than 1000 people that are consistent with it.</p>
